#Random message project##

##Description This was my first off platform project using Java script, git and github. This code will randomly select a character from the cast of the office and then insult you based on the selection. The user can input their name to make it personalised.

##Objectives *Build a message generator program using JavaScript *Use Git version control *Use command line *Develop locally on your computer

##Review Overall I am please with how this project turned out. I solidfied my knowledge of how to work offline using VS starting this project locally on my PC. I then pushed the repo to git hub to backup to the cloud and allow me to share my work with others. I then used both VS and the terminal to push my commits to github. Although this was a basic bit of code it help soilidfy my knowledge of how to structure a project correctly.
